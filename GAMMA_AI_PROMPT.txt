GAMMA.AI PRESENTATION PROMPT - CODE SMELL DETECTION WEBSITE
================================================================================

Create a professional university presentation for the "Code Smell Detection Website" project with the following specifications:

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use a minimalistic design approach with clean, simple layouts
- Color Palette: Dark background (navy/dark blue #1a1f3a or black) with white/light text and accent colors (blue #3b82f6, red #ef4444 for severity indicators)
- Font: Modern sans-serif (preferably Poppins, Inter, or similar clean fonts)
- No busy backgrounds - use solid colors or very subtle gradients
- Whitespace-heavy design with minimal visual clutter
- Icons only when necessary for clarity
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
- Tables with borders for data presentation
- Use color coding for severity levels: Red (Critical), Orange (Major), Yellow (Minor)

SLIDE STRUCTURE (15-18 slides):

SLIDE 1 - TITLE SLIDE
- Title: "Code Smell Detection Website"
- Subtitle: "Automated Code Quality Analysis Tool"
- Additional info: Course: Software Requirements Engineering (SRE), Semester 7
- Minimalistic: Large title text centered, one accent color element

SLIDE 2 - WHAT IS CODE SMELL?
- Definition: Surface-level indicators of deeper design problems in code
- Brief explanation: Code works but indicates design issues
- Why it matters: Technical debt, maintainability, future refactoring
- Visual: Simple arrow showing progression from code smell to problem

SLIDE 3 - PROJECT OVERVIEW
- Purpose: Automated tool to identify and analyze code quality issues
- Key Features bullet points:
  - Multi-language support (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python)
  - Categorized detection into 5 established categories
  - Severity-based classification
  - Web-based interface for accessibility
  - Comprehensive PDF reports
- Visual: Simple icons representing key features

SLIDE 4 - PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- Automated Detection of code smells
- Multi-Language Support (JS/TS and Python)
- Categorized Analysis (5 main categories)
- Severity Classification (Critical, Major, Minor)
- User-Friendly Interface
- Comprehensive Reporting
- PDF Export Capability
- Layout: Numbered list, one objective per line

SLIDE 5 - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- Show simplified architecture diagram:
  - User Interface Layer (Frontend)
  - API Layer (Backend)
  - Core Analysis Engine
  - Utility Layer
- Data flow arrows showing progression
- Keep it clean and minimalistic

SLIDE 6 - TECHNOLOGY STACK
- Frontend: Next.js 16.1.1, React 19.2.3, Tailwind CSS v4
- Backend: Node.js (Next.js API Routes), Serverless architecture
- Build Tools: Webpack, Babel, ESLint v9
- Storage: Browser localStorage for session management
- Display as simple grouped list with category headers

SLIDE 7 - CODE SMELL CATEGORIES (PART 1)
- BLOATERS: Code that has grown too large
  - Long Methods, Large Classes, Primitive Obsession
  - Long Parameter Lists, Data Clumps
- Visual: Simple category title with subcategories listed

SLIDE 8 - CODE SMELL CATEGORIES (PART 2)
- OBJECT-ORIENTATION ABUSERS: Improper OOP usage
  - Switch Statements, Temporary Fields, Refused Bequest
- Visual: Same minimalistic style as slide 7

SLIDE 9 - CODE SMELL CATEGORIES (PART 3)
- CHANGE PREVENTERS: Structures preventing easy changes
  - Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery, Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies
- DISPENSABLES: Code serving no purpose
  - Dead Code, Duplicate Code, Lazy Classes, Comments

SLIDE 10 - CODE SMELL CATEGORIES (PART 4)
- COUPLERS: Excessive dependencies between modules
  - Feature Envy, Inappropriate Intimacy, Message Chains
  - Middle Man, Alien Data Types

SLIDE 11 - KEY FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY
- HOME PAGE: Introduction and sample reports
- UPLOAD PAGE: File upload with real-time validation
- ANALYSIS PAGE: Interactive results with code viewer and highlighting
- PDF EXPORT: Generate professional reports
- Display: Feature breakdown with brief descriptions

SLIDE 12 - HOW IT WORKS (USER FLOW)
- Step 1: Upload Code File
- Step 2: Automated Analysis Processing
- Step 3: Results Categorization and Classification
- Step 4: Interactive Results Visualization
- Step 5: PDF Report Export
- Visual: Simple numbered flow diagram with arrows

SLIDE 13 - DETECTION ALGORITHM
- Language Detection: File extension-based (.js, .py, etc.)
- Pattern Matching: Regex and text parsing for structural issues
- Heuristic Analysis: Threshold-based detection
- Static Code Analysis: No execution required, fast and safe
- Show example: "Long Method Detection: Count lines in function, flag if > 50 lines"

SLIDE 14 - SEVERITY LEVELS & METRICS
- Severity Color Coding:
  - CRITICAL (Red): Major issues affecting quality significantly - Address immediately
  - MAJOR (Orange): Significant issues - Address in near term
  - MINOR (Yellow): Minor issues - Can be addressed during refactoring
- Key Metrics: Total Smells, Files Scanned, Total Lines, Average Complexity, Refactor Candidates
- Display as simple legend with color squares

SLIDE 15 - SAMPLE ANALYSIS RESULTS
- Show example output:
  - Total Code Smells: 12
  - Critical Issues: 2
  - Major Issues: 6
  - Minor Issues: 4
  - Example detected smell: "Long Method - Function 'processData' is 45 lines"
- Visual: Simple statistics display

SLIDE 16 - LIMITATIONS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
- Current Limitations:
  - Pattern-based detection (vs full AST analysis)
  - Limited language support
  - No customizable thresholds
  - Limited semantic analysis
- Future Plans:
  - Support for more languages (Java, C#, Go, Ruby)
  - AST-based analysis for accuracy
  - IDE integration (VS Code, IntelliJ)
  - CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Machine Learning improvements

SLIDE 17 - CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
- Challenge: Accurate smell detection across languages
  Solution: Language-specific parsing algorithms
- Challenge: User accessibility
  Solution: Web-based interface, no setup required
- Challenge: Providing actionable insights
  Solution: Detailed categorization and severity levels
- Display: Two-column layout (Challenges | Solutions)

SLIDE 18 - CONCLUSION & KEY TAKEAWAYS
- ✓ Automated detection of multiple code smell types
- ✓ Multi-language support (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript)
- ✓ User-friendly web interface
- ✓ Severity-based prioritization
- ✓ Comprehensive PDF reporting
- Final Message: "Improving Code Quality Through Automated Analysis"
- Visual: Minimalistic conclusion slide with checkmarks

DESIGN NOTES:
- Each slide should have consistent header styling
- Use only 2-3 colors: Primary (dark navy/black), Secondary (accent blue), Accent (red/orange for severity)
- Limit text per slide to essential information
- Use ample white space between elements
- No animations - keep it professional and clean
- Tables should be simple with clear borders
- Code examples should be displayed in monospace font, dark background
- Maintain consistent font sizes: Headers (44-56pt), Body (28-32pt), Small text (20-24pt)
- Include slide numbers for reference
- Keep minimalistic aesthetic throughout - less is more

TONE:
- Professional and academic
- Clear and concise explanations
- Focus on technical merit and practical application
- Suitable for university presentation
- Emphasize innovation and practical value to software development
